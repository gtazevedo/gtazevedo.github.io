										<h1>Credit Risk Analytics in Python</h1>
									</header>

									<p>So, the idea in this one is quite simple. There's a book <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Credit+Risk+Analytics%3A+Measurement+Techniques%2C+Applications%2C+and+Examples+in+SAS-p-9781119143987">Credit Risk Analytics - Measurement Techniques Applications and Examples in SAS</a>
										that brings a lot of examples in python. While reading this book I'm kinda of resuming it's content while trying to replicate
										the SAS examples presents in the book in python.
									</p>

									<p>
										I won't go into much detail here nor replicate the codes as they were written in .ipynb file format in <a href="https://github.com/gtazevedo/cra_mtae_sas_in_py">this github project</a>,
										feel free to access it and check the notebooks. They have a little bit of theory (in some cases), as well as the python examples. I'm still reading the book and writing the codes, as I advance I'll keep updating the github project and this page.
									</p>

									<p>For all my codes, I've used the datasets from the book, you can find it <a href="http://www.creditriskanalytics.net/">here</a>
									They are quite interesting for study uses too. So I'll leave a brief descripton of the datasets present.
									<ul>
										<li>HMEQ: Reports characteristics and delinquency information of 5960 home equity loans.</li>
										<li>Data Set Mortgage: Data set in panel form and reports origination and performance observations of 50000 residentials U.S 
											mortagage borrowers over 60 periods. Periods have been deidentified.
										</li>
										<li>Data Set LGD: Data set includes 2545 observations on loans and LGDs.</li>
										<li>Corporate ratings where the ratings have been numerically encoded(1 = AAA, and so on).</li>
									</ul>
									</p>

									<h2>About the github project</h2>
									<p>The project follows the same logic as the book, each chapter is a different notebook. 
										The first and second chapter don't have a notebook as they are more introductory and don't really have examples to replicate. 
										I'll leave a short description of what is seen on each chapter I've read so as to serve as a guide in case you want to read it or check
										my python codes. A more detailed description of the case studies can be found in the python notebooks.</p>

									<h3>Chapter 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
									<p>On chapter 3 we see some introduction to exploratory data analysis and we take a look at the distribution of our datasets 
										(you can check out how to plot these distributions). We also check the location, dispersion, skewness and kurtosis measures of our data
										and take a quick look at correlation.
									</p>
									<h3>Chapter 4 - Data Preprocessing for Credit Risk Modeling</h3>
									<p>Here we learn how to preprocess our data, which is an important step in every data analysis. We take a look at the importance
										of sampling and make some plots of the data in our distribution to try getting some insights about it. We learn about missing values
										and their impact in our analysis as well as how to deal with it, the same goes for outliers. There are also topics on standardizing, categorization 
										and variable selection, which we will implement in the following chapters.
