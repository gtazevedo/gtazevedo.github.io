										<h1>Welcome</h1>
									</header>

									<p>The main idea of this website is to share some of my knowlege about financial risk and programming to try helping those seeking some information about these topics. 
										When I entered this world, I had quite a difficult time trying to find information about these topics, so I want to make it a little easier to those who find this page,
										though I may lack content.
									</p>

									<p>I'll hardly go into deep details in any topics but I'll always leave links or books with more details, so you know at least some places you can look into.
										Everything I've shared are my annotations or implementations of something I studied or am studying. If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to do so, just contact me.
									</p>

									<h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
									<p>I won't go into long boring details, but I think if you came here you want to know a little bit about me to check if
										you can trust at least a little bit in the things I'm writing. Well, I do hope so, but I'll tell a little bit of myself to see
										if I can gain a little bit of your confidence.
									</p>
									<p>
										Firstly, I'm brazilian, I'm writing in english as of this moment I think is the language that can make this accessible to more people,
										but as it's not my main language I might make some mistakes, so please forgive me.
										As of the moment I'm writing this, I've been working in the financial industry for around 6 years and during this time I've obtained
										the FRM certification and I also have plans to try on some more.
									</p>
									<p>
										Everything I write here is my own knowledge and is not related to the company I work for nor any other company. Also, the one 
										revising my texts is me, so it's quite prone to errors, still, I hope it's of some use.
									</p>
